      <h1>Doomsday Coin White Paper (V1.0)</h1>

      <h2>Project background & vision</h2>
      <p>
        The MUAI foundation is an anonymous collective of AI developers and
        futurists who came together with a humanitarian focus.  Their
        mission is to protect individual value and oppose systemic risk.
        Unlike typical token projects, MUAI does not seek profit and
        corporate entities cannot hold the coin.  Operating expenses are
        covered by third‑party lending revenue, ensuring alignment with the
        project’s mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doomsday Coin (DDC) is designed as a counter‑weight to centralised
        systems.  Only real human beings may hold the coin.  All major
        decisions follow a one‑person‑one‑vote governance mechanism so
        control remains in the hands of individuals.
      </p>

      <h2>Core design principles</h2>
      <h3>Fixed total supply</h3>
      <p>
        DDC has a global supply of exactly one coin, divided into 100 % of
        share units.  The smallest unit (“Mother‑share”) equals 1×10⁻¹⁸ of the
        whole.  Only uncirculated shares may be released through a
        controlled sale mechanism.
      </p>
      <h3>Value anchored to “Doomsday”</h3>
      <p>
        DDC’s value is anchored to the ultimate extinction of humanity.  When a
        person dies or loses consciousness, their shares are automatically
        redistributed among living holders.  If a civilisation collapses, its
        remaining supply is shared among survivors.  The project’s motto:
        “the best investment before you die.”
      </p>
      <h3>Human‑only ownership</h3>
      <p>
        Accounts must pass biometric verification, AI‑based consciousness
        tests and endorsement by decentralised nodes.  Corporate or AI
        accounts have their shares destroyed and redistributed to human
        holders.
      </p>
      <h3>Inheritance without tax</h3>
      <p>
        Shares are private property.  Upon death, holdings are
        automatically transmitted to heirs with zero fees or legal
        intervention.
      </p>
      <h3>Market‑driven “air coin”</h3>
      <p>
        DDC is not pegged to any asset and does not promise returns.  Its
        price is determined entirely by supply and demand.
      </p>

      <h2>Technical implementation</h2>
      <h3>Account certification</h3>
      <p>
        The authentication stack combines encrypted biometric data,
        consciousness tests every 180 days and endorsements from
        independent nodes.  Failure triggers automatic inheritance.
      </p>
      <h3>Smart contract modules</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Share transfer module: restricts transfers to certified,
          living individuals.</li>
        <li>Doomsday trigger module: redistributes shares when death or
          civilisational collapse occurs.</li>
        <li>Legal‑entity cancellation module: detects corporate accounts
          and destroys their shares.</li>
        <li>New coin sale module: releases uncirculated shares; existing
          holders’ relative percentages decline but their absolute shares
          remain unchanged.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cross‑stellar consensus</h3>
      <p>
        Fast proof‑of‑stake is used within a solar system; time‑stamp
        consensus synchronises across systems; isolated regions switch to
        emergency consensus.
      </p>
      <h3>Doomsday index & derivatives</h3>
      <p>
        A Doomsday Index measures the probability of extinction across
        multiple horizons.  Users can buy derivatives (e.g. 1‑year or
        50‑year contracts) to hedge catastrophic risk.  If Doomsday does
        not occur within the chosen timeframe, the derivative converts into
        DDC shares distributed to the largest holders.
      </p>
      <h3>Biometric hardware</h3>
      <p>
        Users interact with DDC via a cross‑device biometric app and a
        ring‑shaped hardware wallet.  The app integrates health wearables
        and DNA devices to prove consciousness.  The ring wallet stores
        private keys, authenticates via fingerprint and skin conductivity
        and supports end‑of‑life instructions.
      </p>
      <h3>Multi‑chain & transparency</h3>
      <p>
        DDC is issued on Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche and future
        chains.  A cross‑chain bridge maintains the one‑coin supply.  All
        issuance and trading data are publicly visible on the dashboard.
      </p>

      <h2>Commercial opportunities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scarcity narrative:</strong> a supply of one coin creates a
          powerful scarcity story; early adopters may see appreciation as new
          shares are released.</li>
        <li><strong>Inheritance planning:</strong> automatic, tax‑free
          transfers appeal to those seeking to preserve wealth across
          generations.</li>
        <li><strong>Decentralised insurance & hedging:</strong> the
          Doomsday Index lets users hedge against catastrophic events and
          speculate on civilisation‑level risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross‑chain participation:</strong> multiple chain
          deployment allows users from various communities to own the same
          asset.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware ecosystem:</strong> the ring wallet and
          biometric app can be sold at cost or as premium products,
          creating additional revenue streams.</li>
        <li><strong>Community & governance:</strong> one‑person‑one‑vote
          fosters engagement and provides ongoing news cycles.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Operational model & governance</h2>
      <p>
        MUAI builds the smart contracts, biometric app and ring wallet and
        commissions independent security audits.  At launch MUAI deploys
        1 000 verification nodes; later individuals can run nodes if
        qualified.  Core rules are codified on‑chain and require 80 %
        approval from holders to change.  The project offers account
        certification services, multi‑language support and regular
        community events.  Funding comes from new coin sales and crypto
        lending revenue; monthly reports disclose income and expenses.
