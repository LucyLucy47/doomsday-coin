# Doomsday Coin White Paper (V3.0): English Translation & Commercial Perspective

## Project background & vision

**Origin and mission.**  The MUAI foundation is an anonymous collective of AI developers and futurists who came together with a humanitarian focus.  They come from artificial intelligence, finance, social ethics and hardware development and share a mission to “protect individual value and oppose systemic risk”【777318811419337†L6-L9】.  In particular they care about protecting individual rights in extreme scenarios such as planetary catastrophes or inter‑stellar travel【777318811419337†L6-L9】.  Unlike typical token projects, the foundation does not seek profit: corporate entities cannot hold the token and individual members are limited to the same rights as any user【777318811419337†L10-L12】.  Operating expenses are covered by third‑party crypto lending revenue, ensuring the project’s incentives remain aligned with its mission【777318811419337†L10-L12】.

**Human‑centric values.**  Doomsday Coin (DDC) is designed as a counter‑weight to centralised systems.  Only *real human beings* may hold the coin; it explicitly excludes governments, corporations and other legal entities【777318811419337†L35-L50】.  All major decisions are subject to a one‑person‑one‑vote governance mechanism (80 % approval required for rule changes)【777318811419337†L168-L193】.  These rules ensure that control remains in the hands of individual users rather than institutions.

## Core design principles

1. **Fixed total supply.**  DDC has a global supply of exactly **one coin**, divided into 100 % of share units.  The smallest unit (“Mother‑share”) equals 1 × 10^‑18 of the whole.  The overall supply can never expand; only uncirculated shares may be released through a controlled sale mechanism【777318811419337†L14-L19】【777318811419337†L84-L88】.  This scarcity echoes the Yap island stone money system and delivers a powerful narrative of rarity and permanence【777318811419337†L19-L21】.

2. **Value anchored to “Doomsday.”**  Rather than being pegged to fiat or commodities, DDC’s value is anchored to the one certainty that unites all civilizations: the ultimate extinction of humanity.  This “end‑of‑days consensus” has three layers: individual death, collapse of a civilisation and cross‑civilisation separation【777318811419337†L23-L31】.  When an individual dies or loses consciousness, their shares are automatically redistributed among surviving holders【777318811419337†L26-L34】.  If a civilisation’s population falls below 100 people, the remaining supply is shared among survivors【777318811419337†L28-L31】.  This mechanism ensures continuous value transfer to the living, giving DDC the provocative slogan “the best investment before you die”【777318811419337†L31-L34】.

3. **Human‑only ownership.**  Accounts must pass triple identity verification: biometric data, proof of active consciousness via AI tests, and endorsement by at least three independent nodes from different star systems【777318811419337†L35-L43】.  If an account is identified as a corporate or AI agent, its share is destroyed and the remaining supply is redistributed to individual holders【777318811419337†L44-L49】.  This rule eliminates the risk of government or corporate confiscation that has affected other cryptocurrencies【777318811419337†L50-L51】.

4. **Inheritance without tax.**  DDC explicitly rejects inheritance taxes.  Your shares are private property and cannot be seized.  Upon death your holdings are automatically transmitted to heirs according to on‑chain instructions with zero fees or legal intervention【777318811419337†L54-L58】.  This feature frames DDC as an intergenerational wealth vehicle.

5. **Market‑driven “air coin.”**  DDC does not promise returns or peg to any asset.  Its price is entirely determined by supply and demand, and holders accept all risk【777318811419337†L58-L61】.  For investors this transparency and absence of hidden claims can be more trustworthy than opaque DeFi products.

## Technical implementation

1. **Account certification.**  The authentication stack combines encrypted biometric data (fingerprints, iris scans, DNA hashes) stored on decentralised nodes【777318811419337†L64-L66】, AI‑based consciousness tests that must be passed every 180 days【777318811419337†L67-L70】, and endorsements from geographically distributed nodes【777318811419337†L70-L72】.  A failure triggers automatic inheritance distribution.

2. **Smart contract modules.**  The core logic resides in a suite of interoperable smart contracts:
   - **Share transfer module:** restricts transfers to certified, living individuals【777318811419337†L75-L77】.
   - **Doomsday trigger module:** redistributes shares when death or civilisational collapse is detected【777318811419337†L77-L79】.
   - **Legal‑entity cancellation module:** monitors activity patterns to detect corporate accounts and destroys their shares【777318811419337†L80-L81】.
   - **New coin sale module:** periodically releases uncirculated shares to fund operations; existing holders’ relative percentage declines but their absolute share remains unchanged【777318811419337†L82-L88】.

3. **Cross‑stellar consensus.**  To handle communication delays across star systems, DDC uses a layered consensus approach: fast proof‑of‑stake within a solar system, time‑stamp consensus across systems and an emergency mode for isolated regions【777318811419337†L90-L97】.  This design ensures finality even when messages take years to propagate.

4. **Doomsday index & derivatives.**  A “Doomsday Index” offers a continuous measure of end‑of‑the‑world probability over multiple time horizons.  Users can buy derivatives (e.g. 1‑year or 50‑year Doomsday contracts) both to hedge catastrophic risk and to express opinions【777318811419337†L99-L119】.  Purchases push the index up, while objective data from organisations like NASA and WHO periodically calibrate it【777318811419337†L110-L115】.  If Doomsday does not occur within the chosen timeframe, the derivative converts into DDC shares which are distributed to the largest 1 000 holders【777318811419337†L119-L121】.

5. **Biometric hardware.**  Users interact with DDC through a cross‑device biometric app and a proprietary ring‑shaped hardware wallet.  The app integrates health wearables, smart glasses and home DNA devices to continuously prove consciousness【777318811419337†L124-L130】.  The ring wallet stores private keys, authenticates via fingerprint and skin conductivity, syncs biometric data to the blockchain and supports “end‑of‑life” instructions【777318811419337†L131-L139】.

6. **Multi‑chain & transparency.**  DDC is issued simultaneously on Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche and future inter‑stellar chains.  A cross‑chain bridge maintains the one‑coin supply across all chains【777318811419337†L143-L149】.  All issuance, trading volumes and bridge transactions are publicly visible on the website and on block explorers【777318811419337†L149-L155】.

## Commercial opportunities

While the white paper maintains a neutral tone, a commercial perspective highlights several opportunities:

* **Scarcity narrative.**  A supply of one coin divided into shares creates a powerful scarcity story.  As uncirculated shares are released, early adopters may see appreciation simply because new supply dilutes their percentage【777318811419337†L84-L88】.  The Yap stone money comparison emphasises that the token is a modern implementation of an age‑old concept【777318811419337†L19-L21】.

* **Inheritance planning.**  Automatic, tax‑free transfer of holdings at death appeals to wealthy individuals seeking to preserve value across generations【777318811419337†L54-L58】.  Unlike trusts or wills, no legal fees or bureaucratic delays occur.

* **Decentralised insurance & hedging.**  The Doomsday Index derivatives allow users to hedge against catastrophic events such as pandemics or asteroid impacts【777318811419337†L99-L119】.  Traders can speculate on civilisation‑level risks while institutions may offer structured products.

* **Cross‑chain participation.**  By issuing on multiple chains and providing transparent cross‑chain bridges, DDC addresses the fragmentation of the current crypto landscape【777318811419337†L143-L154】.  Investors from Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche and other communities can hold and trade the same asset.

* **Hardware ecosystem.**  The ring wallet and biometric app could be sold at cost to drive adoption【777318811419337†L131-L139】.  Bundled with premium features or limited‑edition designs, they create additional revenue streams and brand recognition.

* **Community & governance.**  The “one person, one vote” model fosters an engaged community【777318811419337†L168-L193】.  Regular events, index adjustments and new chain deployments provide ongoing news that can sustain attention and marketing campaigns.

## Operational model & governance

The MUAI foundation commits to an open and accountable operational model:

* **Technical development & audits.**  The foundation builds the smart contracts, biometric app, ring wallet and cross‑chain bridges and engages independent security firms for audits【777318811419337†L160-L165】.

* **Node deployment.**  At launch the foundation deploys 1 000 verification nodes around the world; later individuals can operate nodes if they meet the qualifications【777318811419337†L166-L167】.

* **Rule maintenance.**  All core rules (total supply, human‑only ownership, Doomsday triggers and sale frequency) are codified on‑chain.  Any changes require at least 80 % approval from holders【777318811419337†L168-L193】.

* **User support & outreach.**  The project will offer account certification services, multi‑language support, and organise workshops with scientists and ethicists to foster consensus【777318811419337†L172-L184】.

* **Funding & transparency.**  Funds come exclusively from new coin sales and returns from crypto lending platforms.  Monthly reports detail income, expenses and lending yields【777318811419337†L185-L190】.

## Provided code

For developers, a prototype smart contract (Solidity) illustrating key features of the Doomsday Coin is supplied separately in `doomsday_coin.sol`.  The contract demonstrates how to enforce a fixed supply of one coin divided into 18 decimals, restrict ownership to unflagged human accounts, release uncirculated shares and redistribute holdings when a non‑human account is detected or an account is declared deceased.
